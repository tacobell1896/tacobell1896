        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm Turner Bell, and I'm a software and web developer. I have worked with computer programming languages such as C#, VBA, ASP.NET, Android, HTML, CSS, XML, Java, JavaScript, SQL Server and PHP. I have also worked with operating systems such as Microsoft Windows as well as Linux Distros such as Arch Linux and Linux Mint. I also am proficient in using software applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, G-Suite Apps, Google Docs, Microsoft Access, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in computers and how they worked since I was a small child, and learning programming in High School made me consider development as a career. I pride myself in my passion in technology, work ethic, and honesty, and am always willing to learn new skills. I also enjoy being a part of designing as well as developing an application, and try to follow recent design trends in order to make applications simple to use as well as nice to look at.</p>
        <p><i>The world of technology is always changing, and I hope to be a part of that.</i></p>
